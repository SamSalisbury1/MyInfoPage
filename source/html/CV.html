                            diverse range of clients. While working for Pikcells I refined my knowledge of numerous languages

                            simulation based on 2D kitchen designs planned by users. While working at Wren I developed my 
                            knowledge of and utilised JavaScript, TypeScript, the React framework, technologies such as 
                            Docker, Bitbucket and Jira and the scrum methodology. Responsibilities included daily standup
